## Idea
On this project the main goal is to create a page that changes corresponding to the hour you're opening it.

* Morning, Afternoon and Night modes
* The page will show the weather and time on two cities, Belo Horizonte (Brazil) and Oslo (Norway) - Belo Horizonte was choosen because it is my hometown. Oslo was choosen because it is a city i really want to visit.
* The main wheater of the page will be based of Oslo - because of it's variety of weathers - if it's snowing on the city, it will be snowing on the page. If it's raining, it will be raining on the page.
